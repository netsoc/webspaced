# Introduction

Webspaces allow you to host your website on our servers! Our shiny next-gen
webspaces are based on [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/), which means you
get full root access to a VM-style Linux container!

## Getting started

To set up your webspace, you'll need the Netsoc CLI. See
[our dedicated documentation](/cli/) for more information.

!!! tip
    You can use `netsoc ws` as a shortcut for `netsoc webspace`.

## Create your container

Once the CLI is set up and you're logged in, you can create your webspace
container. First, you'll need to pick an operating system image to install.
(This is similar to other cloud providers like AWS or DigitalOcean). To view a
list of available options, run `netsoc webspace images`:

```
$ netsoc webspace images

We recommend [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) for beginners, and _it's what we'll
assume you're using in future guides_. Generally most of what is shown is
the same or at least very similar across Linux distros.

If you'd like to just get up and running with a simple WordPress-based site, you
can just use the `wordpress` image above. See
[our WordPress guide](guides/wordpress/) for more details. You can skip all of
the steps beyond initialising your container!

To create your container:

```bash
netsoc webspace init ubuntu
```

You'll be prompted to enter a password. Note that this is **not** your Netsoc
password! This is a password for the `root` (or admin) user in your container.
It can be whatever you like, most of the time you probably won't need it.

!!! tip
    If you are familiar with SSH and would prefer to use public key
    authentication, you can run `netsoc webspace init --ssh`. An SSH server will
    be installed along with your Netsoc account's public key (you must have
    added an SSH key to your account previously). A port forward will be
    created so you
    can connect directly. Otherwise, don't worry! You can install an SSH server
    later by following [this guide](guides/port_forwarding/).

After up to about a minute, the command should complete and your webspace will
be initialized!

## Logging in

Now that your container has been created, you can log in! Just run
`netsoc webspace login`. If your container isn't running (which it won't be
initially after creating it), there will be a slight delay as it starts up.
You should see something similar to the following:

```bash
root@ws-u1:~#
```

Congrats! You've now got full root access to your container.

## Website setup

Once logged in, you can set up a web server to serve some pages! We'll use
`nginx`. From your webspace shell, run `apt update` followed by
`apt install nginx`. When prompted with `Do you want to continue? [Y/n]`, just
press enter. You should see something like this (summarised):

```

Now the nginx web server is up and running in your webspace! Visit
`https://myusername.netsoc.ie` and you should see a page like this:

![nginx](assets/nginx_default.png)

## Website customisation

To make some changes to your site, you'll need a text editor. (We'll show you
how to transfer files to / from your webspace in a future guide.) This text
editor will be terminal based, for beginners we recommend `nano`. To install:

```bash
apt install nano
```

To replace the default nginx webpage, we'll create a new `index.html` file. This
file (and other public HTML, CSS or JavaScript) should live in `/var/www/html`.
Open `nano` with the new `index.html` filename as follows:

```bash
nano /var/www/html/index.html
```

You should now see an interface like this:

![nano](assets/nano.png)

Simply type and use the arrow keys to move around. To quit, press `^X` (Ctrl+x,
the `^` means control, even on a Mac). If you've made any changes, a question
`Save modified buffer?` will appear. Press `y`. A new question
`File Name to Write:`, followed by the path to the new `index.html` will follow.
Just press enter since we want to save to the same file that was opened. You can
also use `^O` to save the file without quitting `nano`.

Feel free to write any HTML you like. You can use the following as an example
(paste it into your terminal directly):

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Welcome to my webspace!</title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <style>
      body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my webspace!</h1>
    <p>Hello world! This is my next-gen webspace.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Once your changes have saved, reload your webspace page and you should see
something like this:

![Sample webpage](assets/nginx_sample.png)
